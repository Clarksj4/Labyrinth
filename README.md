Labyrinth is a 2D, pixelated rendition of the wooden labyrinth toy popular among no children. Guiding Barry, the Dwarf (<img title="Larry, the Dwarf" src="https://github.com/Clarksj4/Labyrinth/blob/master/app/src/main/res/drawable-nodpi/dwarf_0.png">), around a derelict labyrinth, sorely in need of pot hole repairs, is a single player, exercise in frustration, made for your android device. Move Garry with the power of gravity; get him to the exit, but watch out for those pot holes.
