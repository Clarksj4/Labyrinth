# Labyrinth 

Labyrinth is a 2D, pixelated rendition of the [wooden labyrinth toy](https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=wooden+labyrinth+toy&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx_ZOphd_TAhXBlJQKHZ3mCpUQ_AUICigB&biw=1600&bih=1065) popular among no children. Guiding Barry, the Dwarf (<img title="Larry, the Dwarf" src="https://github.com/Clarksj4/Labyrinth/blob/master/app/src/main/res/drawable-nodpi/dwarf_0.png">), around a derelict labyrinth, sorely in need of pot hole repairs, is a single player, exercise in frustration, made for your android device. Move Garry with the power of gravity; get him to the exit, but watch out for those pot holes.
