Labyrinth is a 2D pixelated rendition of the wooden labyrinth toy popular among no children. Guiding Barry the Dwarf around a derelict labyrinth, sorely in need of pot hole repairs, is a single player, exercise in frustration, made for your android device. Move Garry with the power of gravity; get him to the exit, but watch out for those pot holes.
